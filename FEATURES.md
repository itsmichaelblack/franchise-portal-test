## Authentication & Security

### Google Sign-In

- All authenticated users sign in via Google OAuth 2.0.
- Firebase Auth manages sessions and tokens.

### TOTP Multi-Factor Authentication

- Optional TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) enrollment.
- Compatible with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
- Implemented in `useAuth` hook: enroll, finalize, and verify flows.

### Firestore Security Rules

Server-side rules enforce all access control. Client-side checks are supplementary. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full rules breakdown.

## Open Questions

1. **Franchise Partner onboarding**: Partners are auto-registered when their email matches a location. Is there a planned manual invite flow for partners?
2. **Booking management**: Can HQ admins create bookings on behalf of customers, or is booking creation customer-only?
3. **Service linkage**: Services are managed in the catalog but don't appear to be linked to specific bookings or locations. Is service selection during booking planned?
4. **Notifications**: Are in-app notifications or push notifications planned, or will email remain the sole notification channel?
5. **Reporting/Analytics**: Is there a planned dashboard for booking statistics, location performance, or revenue tracking?
6. **Multi-language support**: The UI is English-only. Is internationalization on the roadmap?
7. **Image storage**: Service images are stored as base64 strings in Firestore documents. Is migration to Firebase Storage / Cloud Storage planned for larger files?
